This is a series of scripts to check for misspelled words and is based
on the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines

The list has been slightly modified to remove some changes that cause
a number of false positives.  In particular ok->OK was removed (ok is
frequently used in perl tests for instance).
